# CapMetroClient

This is a wrapper around Capital Metro's open data feed.

## Usage

Not much to see here yet, but run `example.php` to pull the current real time vehicle position feed, then show the
various information you can pull from it. You can also filter the feed prior to fetching by many of its values; take
a look at RealTimeLocationQuery.php for more details.

As fair warning, interface compatibility commit-to-commit is not guaranteed at this time.
